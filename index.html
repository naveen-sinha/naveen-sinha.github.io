            <p class="has-text-color has-background has-very-dark-gray-color has-very-light-gray-background-color">I'm a scientist fascinated by the interplay between food, data, and business. I have followed this thread from classroom to laboratory to office, using the best tools available, whether they be microscopes or database consoles.</p>
            <p class="has-text-color has-background has-very-dark-gray-color has-very-light-gray-background-color">I'm currently prototyping systems for the Innovation Team of <a href="https://www.indigoag.com/">Indigo Agriculture</a>. Previously I was a founding member of the Business Intelligence Infrastructure team at <a href="https://www.fitbit.com/home">Fitbit</a> and a founding Teaching Fellow of the <a href="https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/science-and-cooking">Harvard Science and Cooking</a> course. </p>
            <p class="has-text-color has-background has-very-dark-gray-color has-very-light-gray-background-color">Outside of work, I enjoy decidedly analog pursuits like running along trails or stadium steps, cooking elaborate yet simple meals, and writing in notebooks of good paper quality. </p>
            <p class="has-text-color has-background has-very-dark-gray-color has-very-light-gray-background-color">I have collected my favorite <a href="reading.html">long-form</a> and <a href="links.html">online</a> material. Both the outliers and the principal components elucidate my current mindset. </p>
