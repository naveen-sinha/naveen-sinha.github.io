        I lead the reasearch operations team at Oura, a wearable tech company that helps people track all stages of sleep and activity using the Oura Ring and connected app. My team runs a variety of research studies, both internal and external, to develop new features and continue to enhance the accuracy of our algorithms. Our partnerships often lead to scientific publications and provide public validation of Ouraâ€™s health sensing capabilities.

        Prior to Oura, I received my PhD in Applied Physics at Harvard, worked on various data-related teams at Fitbit, and explored the world of regenerative farming at Indigo Ag.
