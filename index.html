        Physics, data science, and research operations

        I lead the research operations team at Oura, a fast-growing startup that helps people track their sleep and transform their health using the Oura Ring and connected apps. My team conducts a variety of research studies, both internal and external, to develop new features and enhance the accuracy of our algorithms. Our partnerships often lead to scientific publications and provide public [validation](https://ouraring.com/blog/category/oura-101/oura-in-research/) of Oura's health sensing capabilities.

        Before joining Oura, I earned my PhD in Applied Physics at Harvard, where I co-founded the [Science & Cooking](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/science-and-cooking) course. During my graduate studies, I became fascinated with the quantified self movement, which led to a four-year tenure at [Fitbit](https://www.fitbit.com/), where I helped build their business intelligence and data science capabilities. Most recently, I was an early member of the Innovation Team at [Indigo Ag](https://www.indigoag.com/), which has since evolved into the current carbon credits program.

        Outside of work, I enjoy 5:30 AM CrossFit classes, weekend half-marathon runs, reading books, and applying my scientific instincts to cooking. I am deeply curious about note-taking apps, most recently Reflect, as well as the implications of randomness, the future of physics, and the limits of human performance.
