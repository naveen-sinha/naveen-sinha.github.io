I build data tools for science beyond the laboratory.

I'm currently on the Carbon Experimentation team at Indigo Agriculture, where I explore the role regenerative agricultural practices on carbon sequestration.

Previously I was a founding member of the Business Intelligence Infrastructure team at Fitbit and a founding Teaching Fellow of the Harvard Science and Cooking course.

The common theme is a drive to better questions and find better ways to work with dataâ€”whether it's for developing new cuisines, building healthier habits, or understanding carbon cycles.
